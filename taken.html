    <h1>The biography of IT specialist Anthon Bertsen</h1>
    <blockquote><i>I’m Bert Anthonissen and I’m a student at the Immaculata institute. I’m currently studying IT and it’s a lot of fun. Another fun fact of me is that I’m quite the sportive guy. I played basketball for 3 years, football when I was little, badminton for 2 years and went to drawing school for 4 years, so I guess you can also say that I’m creative.</i></blockquote>    
    <h2>the past</h2>
    <p>When I first discovered IT, I remember as if it were yesterday. A chilly winter day in the kitchen of our house with the TV on in the background and a laptop playing Ketnet Kick: The Mysterious Island. You must be thinking, "Do you still play them to this day?" The answer is quite simple, YES. Those games are precious to me. It’s like taking a lollipop from a 5-year old. That’s something you just do not do. I cried if my mom said: “Those games are ruining your childhood. Turn them off and help your dear mother an hour”. That was absolute hell to me. But then again, I was like 7 years old. An hour for my mom was a day lost to me. That was the gaming part of my childhood. There was also an internetting time, a time that I hold dear to me for the rest of my life. A time that just isn’t the internetting time of today. A time of Speeleiland.nl and Spele.nl. Yes those are gaming sites. So you could say that my childhood involved gaming and helping my mother. When I discovered these sites, it was like a whole new world opened up to me. For the first time in my life I had a remote game library that I could access around the world. And those were the best times of my childhood.</p>
    <h2>the present</h2>
    <p>With the past behind me I followed my dream to finally work in the IT world. And that journey led me to the Immaculata Institute, a school with one of the best IT courses in my area. A little school, yes, but that makes the tutors thus the more interesting. One thing before I continue my travels. I don’t consider myself an expert. There are far better technicians out there. With that said, we continue. I’m currently at the time of me writing this in senior year of high school. I have a past year full with disassembling computers and reassembling computers, using parts of different pcs to upgrade other ones, finding ‘ancient’ technology like a pong machine or floppy disks. But the highlight of the past year, after 3 years of nagging I finally put together my very own computer. If you’re wondering: “Why are computers so interesting? they’re just machines.” If you are thinking that then, in my opinion, you are the dumbest person on earth. In the fact that they are machines, yes, then you’re right. But you can do so much more than just game what I have been doing is just one part of the entire spectrum of the computer. yes you can play videogames all your life. There are even people who play video games and earn money with it, look at PewDiePie (a YouTuber) or CohhCarnage (a Twitch streamer). Other people earn their money by developing games such as Rocksteady (creator of the batman: Arkham series) or Rockstar studios (creator of Grand Theft Auto, GTA for short). That’s the gaming world, a world on its own. There are also different categories in the spectrum, like developing web applications or configuring and creating websites. I’m not going into all the details of all the different aspects. But there is one side of the spectrum that I personally really like. And that’s configuring and managing a network inside a company or school or whatever needs a stable network.</p>
    <h2>the future</h2>
    <p>As I said in the previous paragraph I really like to manage a network. I also want to make this my job in the end. I could spend my life just managing a network. I would be happy with that, having a wife, a couple of kids, and a job as the head in IT for some famous company. Money would flow in buckets then, living the perfect life I always wanted, and in my free time, a gaming rig with 3 BenQ monitors, DX Racer chair, 1080 GPU, i7 CPU,  it’s one nerd gasm after the other. That would complete all the efforts I made along the way.</p>
    <blockquote><i>But that’s all in the future. For now I have to focus on my studies as an IT specialist. Otherwise I can’t accomplish my goal, and would be very unhappy.</i></blockquote>
